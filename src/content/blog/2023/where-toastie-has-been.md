Hi there everyone it has been a while since I last posted here, I am here to let you all know where on earth I have been.

First of all where the heck I have been. I have decided to take an extended break from all Ellie project stuff so I can focus on what I want to do with my life and so I can focus on some of my personal projects and possible start a business with a close friend.

Second of all I have had to take time off for medical reasons as my health has not been the best recently so I have to take time away from this projects to take some of the stress away from me so I can try and get better faster.

Before anyone asks I am going to return I can promise you I will as soon as my life calms down a little bit but until then I have opted to take a break and I hope you all will understand.

Until I return,
Toastie_t0ast (formerly EmotionChild)
