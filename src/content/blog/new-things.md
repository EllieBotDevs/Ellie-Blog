Hi there, it has been a while.

I am back to let you all know how life has been treating me so far as well as share the projects I have been working on.

### First up is Valkyriecoms,

Valkyriecoms is a social site I have been working on since December last year and just got things fully up, below is a screenshot of the site.

### Next up is Dragon's child hosting

Dragon's child hosting is a small server hosting service I started under the Dragon's child studios name right now we are just starting out on our journey.

Below is a screenshot of our panel (there is a new one which will replace this in the works)

### Last up is Toastielab

Toastielab is a small git platform that I operate wit the help of Dragon's child studios which is where I host all my projects (even the one which this site is located at)

I am going to include a screenshot of Toastielab below (our icons a little bit bugged right now so it is currently showing the default Forgejo icons)
